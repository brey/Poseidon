Conditions appear<br />\\nfavorable for additional development, and a tropical depression<br />\\ncould form during the next day or two while the system moves toward<br />\\nthe west-northwest at 10 to 15 mph.  After that time, conditions are<br />\\nexpected to become less conducive for tropical cyclone formation.<br />\\n* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent<br />\\n* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent<br />\\n<br />\\nA large area of disturbed weather extending from the eastern Gulf of<br />\\nMexico across the Florida peninsula and into the adjacent Atlantic<br />\\nOcean is associated with a broad surface trough interacting with an<br />\\nupper-level trough.  Surface observations indicate that a low<br />\\npressure area is forming just east of the northern Florida<br />\\nPeninsula, and there is some potential for this low to develop into<br />\\na subtropical or tropical cyclone during the next few days as it<br />\\nmoves slowly northeastward. Regardless of development, locally heavy<br />\\nrains are possible over portions of the Florida Peninsula today.<br />\\nFor more information on this system, see products from your local<br />\\nNational Weather Service office.<br />\\n* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent<br />\\n* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent<br />\\n<br />\\n$$<br />\\nForecaster Beven<br />\\n<br />'"
