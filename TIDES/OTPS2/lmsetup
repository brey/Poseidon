1. TPXO8-atlas-compact control file (ASCII, supplied with the model, starting
   from "Model_") contains 3 lines:

   elevation model file name
   transport model file name
   bathymetry grid file name

   Please show FULL path to the model files in the "Model_*" file
   unless they are located in /DATA (download default).


2. latitude limits (deg N)

3. longitude limits (deg E)

4. Constituent names should be in LOWER case and separated by comma.
   Leave the line blank, if ALL available constituents should be included

5. Path to directory to output the model to

6. Output file suffix. 3 output files will be generated in
   regular OTIS binary format:

   bathymetry - grid_<suffux>
   elevations - h_<suffix>
   transports - UV_<suffix>
   
   and control 3 lines ASCII file Model_<suffix> as:

   <path>/h_<suffix>
   <path>/UV_<suffix>
   <path>/grid_<suffix>
