Storm Surge estimation  software
==============================

This is a development project for utilizing DELFT3D open source code for considering storm surge. The purpose is to create, run and analyze a storm surge computation based on Python scripts and thus avoid the Matlab based GUI that deltares use. The procedure is outlined in Jupyter notebooks in order to have clarity and transparency.  

## Getting Started

A number of data are inclusive in the project folders but there are some required outside sources. The development is done in Linux environment. Some (maybe many) modifications need to be made for other platforms. 

### Prerequisities

DELFT3D needs to be compiled for your system. You can download it from  

Required Python are


## Tests

No tests are available at the moment.
